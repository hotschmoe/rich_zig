I'll review the recent code changes for the "Console: Add input prompts" task and use the code-simplifier agent to refine them.The code-simplifier agent has successfully simplified the console input code. Let me verify the tests pass and then commit the changes.Tests pass. Let me check the git status and diff to see the simplifications:The simplifications look good. Let me commit the changes:Done. Here's a summary of the simplifications made:

**Changes to `src/console.zig`:**

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 70 lines of duplicated logic | 13 lines + 2 helper functions |
| `inputWithOptions`: ~45 lines | `inputWithOptions`: 5 lines |
| `promptWithOptions`: ~55 lines | `promptWithOptions`: ~15 lines |

**Extracted helpers:**
- `writeDefaultSuffix` - handles showing `[default]` and `: ` suffix
- `readAndProcessInput` - handles stdin reading, trimming, defaults, max length, and validation

**Also removed:** Redundant comments like "Read input from stdin", "Trim carriage return if present" since the code is now self-explanatory.

All tests pass and functionality is preserved.
