I'll implement Markdown link rendering with hyperlink support (OSC 8) in the markdown.zig file. Let me first explore the existing codebase to understand the current implementation.I can see the codebase structure. The `Style` struct already has hyperlink support via the `link` field and the `hyperlink()` method. It also already renders OSC 8 sequences in `renderAnsi()`. Now I need to add link parsing to the Markdown renderer.

Let me also check the segment.zig to understand how segments work with styles:Now I have a clear picture. The infrastructure for hyperlinks already exists:
- `Style.hyperlink(url)` sets a link on a style
- `Style.renderAnsi()` outputs OSC 8 escape sequences
- `Segment.render()` handles ending hyperlinks

I need to add link parsing to the Markdown renderer. Let me implement this.Now I need to update the `InlineSpan` struct to support links and modify the parsing logic. Let me look at the current implementation more closely to understand the best way to add link support.Now I need to add a link parsing function and integrate it into `parseInlineStyles`. Let me add the link parsing logic:Now I need to update `advanceToNextDelimiter` to also stop at `[` for links:Now I need to update `renderInlineText` to handle links by applying the link style with the hyperlink URL:Now I need to add tests for the link parsing and rendering. Let me add them at the end of the test section in the file:All 374 tests pass. Let me verify the markdown tests specifically:The tests pass. Let me run a more targeted test to see our new link tests running:That's expected - the tests should be run through the build system. The tests all pass via `zig build test`. Let me also verify that the implementation works correctly with the segment rendering:All tests pass. Now let me commit this change:The changes look good. Now let me commit:Implementation complete. 

**Summary:**

I implemented Markdown link rendering with OSC 8 hyperlink support in `src/renderables/markdown.zig`:

1. **Added `link_style`** to `MarkdownTheme` - bright blue with underline styling for links

2. **Implemented `tryParseLink`** function that parses `[text](url)` syntax with support for:
   - Nested brackets in link text (e.g., `[text [nested]](url)`)
   - Nested parentheses in URLs (e.g., `[link](url/path(1))`)
   - Proper boundary detection

3. **Extended `InlineSpan`** struct to include:
   - New `.link` style type
   - `link_url` field to store the URL

4. **Updated `advanceToNextDelimiter`** to stop at `[` for link detection

5. **Updated `renderInlineText`** to apply hyperlink styles with the URL via `Style.hyperlink(url)`, which generates OSC 8 escape sequences for terminal hyperlink support

6. **Added 13 new tests** covering:
   - Basic link parsing
   - Invalid link detection
   - Offset parsing
   - Nested brackets/parentheses
   - Full rendering with hyperlink attributes
   - Multiple links in one line
   - Theme link style verification

All 374 tests pass.
