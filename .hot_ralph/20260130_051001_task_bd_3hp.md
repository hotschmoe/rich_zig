I'll implement GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) table rendering in the markdown renderer. Let me start by exploring the existing codebase to understand the current state.Now let me read the markdown.zig file in chunks to understand its current state:Let me continue reading the rest of markdown.zig:Let me continue reading to see the rest of the file and any existing table-related tests:Let me continue reading the rest of the markdown.zig file to see the entire file:Good. Now I have a clear understanding of the current markdown.zig file. I can see it already has many block elements (headers, code blocks, horizontal rules, blockquotes, lists) and inline styling (bold, italic, links, images, inline code). Now I need to add GFM table support.

Let me update my todos and implement the GFM table parsing:Now let me check what imports I need and check how Table is used from renderables/mod.zig:Now I have all the context I need. I'll implement GFM table parsing in markdown.zig. GFM tables have the format:

```
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|:--------:|---------:|
| cell 1   | cell 2   | cell 3   |
| cell 4   | cell 5   | cell 6   |
```

The separator row indicates alignment:
- `---` or `:---` = left align
- `:---:` = center align
- `---:` = right align

Now let me add the GFM table support to markdown.zig. I need to:
1. Import Table and related types
2. Add table-related theme settings
3. Add parsing functions for GFM tables
4. Integrate table rendering into the main render loopNow let me add the table theme settings to MarkdownTheme. I need to find where the theme struct ends:Now let me add table styles to the MarkdownTheme:Now I need to find the Markdown.render function and add table parsing. Let me look at the current render function structure:I see the render function uses a line-by-line approach. For tables, I need to collect multiple lines (header row, separator row, and data rows) and then render them as a single table. This requires a more complex state machine approach.

Let me redesign the render function to support tables. I'll need to:
1. Detect when we're in a potential table (line starts with `|`)
2. Collect table rows until we hit a non-table line
3. Validate that the second line is a separator row
4. Parse alignment from separator row
5. Render using the existing Table componentNow I need to add the helper functions for table parsing. Let me find a good place to add them after the emitCodeBlock function:Now I'll add the table-related functions after emitCodeBlock:Now let me update my todo list and run a quick test to see if it compiles:`align` is a reserved keyword in Zig. Let me fix that:All tests pass. Now let me add specific tests for GFM tables at the end of the markdown.zig file:Now I'll add the GFM table tests:Now let me run the tests to verify everything works:I need to rename the variable `cells` in the test to avoid shadowing the module import:All 551 tests pass, including the 12 new GFM table tests. Let me update the todo list and run a quick demo to verify the tables render correctly:Let me test it a different way:Let me just verify it builds and runs from within the project:The build works correctly. Now let me run all tests with ReleaseSafe to ensure the implementation is correct:All tests pass. Let me also run the format check:Formatting is already correct. Now let me commit the changes:Now let me commit the changes:Task completed successfully. Here's a summary:

## Implemented GFM Table Rendering

I added GitHub Flavored Markdown table support to `src/renderables/markdown.zig`. The implementation:

### Key Changes
1. **New imports**: Added `Table`, `Column`, `JustifyMethod` from `table.zig` and `BoxStyle` from `box.zig`

2. **Theme additions** (lines 67-69):
   - `table_header_style`: Bold cyan header text
   - `table_border_style`: Bright black borders  
   - `table_box_style`: Rounded box style default

3. **Parser functions**:
   - `isTableRow()`: Detects table rows (lines with `|`)
   - `isTableSeparator()`: Validates separator rows (`|---|`)
   - `parseTableAlignment()`: Extracts alignment from separator (`:---:` = center)
   - `splitTableCells()`: Splits row into cells

4. **Integration**: Modified `render()` to collect table lines and emit complete tables using the existing `Table` renderable

### Tests Added (12 new tests)
- `isTableRow` basic detection
- `isTableSeparator` validation
- `parseTableAlignment` for left/center/right
- `splitTableCells` with various formats
- Full rendering tests for basic tables, alignment, styling, mixed content
- Fallback behavior for invalid tables

All 551 tests pass (including 12 new GFM table tests).
