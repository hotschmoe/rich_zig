I'll implement `Syntax.fromFile()` to load and display code directly from the filesystem with automatic language detection from the file extension.

Let me first examine the current syntax.zig implementation to understand the existing structure.I can see there's already a `Syntax.fromFile` function at line 589, but it doesn't actually load the file from the filesystem - it just takes pre-loaded code and a filename for language detection. The task requires implementing a method that actually reads the file from disk.

Let me implement `Syntax.loadFile()` that reads a file from the filesystem, auto-detects the language from the extension, and returns a `Syntax` instance.Now let me add tests for the new `loadFile` functionality. I'll add tests that verify:
1. Loading a file successfully
2. Auto-detecting language from extension
3. Error handling for non-existent filesNow let's run the tests to verify the implementation works correctly.All 514 tests pass. Let me also verify the build works correctly and run a quick check of the changes.Build succeeds. Let me view the final implementation to confirm it's complete.The implementation is complete. Now let me commit the changes.**Task Complete**

Implemented `Syntax.loadFile()` in `src/renderables/syntax.zig:597`:

**Added:**
- `Syntax.loadFile(allocator, path)` - Reads code from filesystem and auto-detects language from extension
- `Syntax.deinit()` - Frees memory allocated by loadFile

**Features:**
- Opens file from current working directory
- Reads entire file contents into allocated buffer
- Auto-detects language using `Language.fromFilename(path)` (which uses extension mapping)
- Returns a `Syntax` instance ready for rendering with all builder methods available

**Tests added:**
- `Syntax.loadFile reads file and detects language` - Verifies loading a real file
- `Syntax.loadFile error on non-existent file` - Verifies error handling
- `Syntax.loadFile renders correctly` - Verifies end-to-end rendering

All 514 tests pass.
