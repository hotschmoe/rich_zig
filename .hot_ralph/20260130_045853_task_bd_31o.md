I'll implement the Markdown images feature to display alt text (since terminals cannot show images). Let me first explore the existing markdown.zig file to understand the current implementation.Now I understand the existing markdown.zig implementation. I need to add support for parsing images and displaying their alt text. Since terminals cannot display images, we'll show the alt text formatted nicely.

Looking at the code structure, I need to:
1. Add a theme style for image alt text display
2. Add image parsing in `parseInlineStyles` (similar to link parsing)
3. Handle image rendering to display alt text

Let me implement this:Now I need to add image parsing. Images in markdown are similar to links but prefixed with `!`:  `![alt text](url)`. Let me add a function to parse images and integrate it into `parseInlineStyles`:Now I need to add the `tryParseImage` function and the `ImageResult` struct. I'll add them near the `LinkResult` and `tryParseLink`:Now I need to update the `advanceToNextDelimiter` function to also stop at `!` (for image detection):Now I need to update the `renderInlineText` function to handle the image style type:Now let me add tests for the new image functionality at the end of the file:Now let me run the tests to verify the implementation:All tests pass. Let me also run the tests with ReleaseSafe optimization to ensure everything works correctly:All tests pass. Now let me commit the changes:**Task completed successfully.**

## Summary

Implemented markdown image support (alt text display) in `src/renderables/markdown.zig`:

**Changes made:**
1. Added `image_style`, `image_prefix`, and `image_suffix` to `MarkdownTheme` for customizable image rendering
2. Added `image` to the `InlineSpan.StyleType` enum and `image_url` field to `InlineSpan`
3. Added `ImageResult` struct and `tryParseImage()` function to parse `![alt](url)` syntax
4. Updated `advanceToNextDelimiter()` to also stop at `!` for image detection
5. Updated `parseInlineStyles()` to try image parsing before link parsing
6. Updated `renderInlineText()` to render images as `[Image: alt text]` with fallback to URL when alt is empty
7. Added comprehensive tests covering all image parsing and rendering scenarios

**Behavior:**
- Images are rendered as `[Image: alt text]` since terminals cannot display actual images
- If alt text is empty, the URL is displayed instead
- Styled with italic + bright_black color by default (customizable via theme)
- Works in all contexts: paragraphs, lists, blockquotes
- Properly handles nested brackets/parens in alt text and URLs
