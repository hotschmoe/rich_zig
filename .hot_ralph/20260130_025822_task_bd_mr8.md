I'll implement automatic language detection for the syntax highlighter. Let me first examine the current syntax.zig file to understand the existing structure.Now I understand the current structure. I need to:
1. Add more languages to the `Language` enum (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
2. Implement a `detectLanguage` function that detects from file extension or content heuristics

Let me implement the auto-detection feature:Now let me add a builder method `withAutoDetect` to the Syntax struct that uses this detection:Now let me add comprehensive tests for the language detection functionality:Now let me add tests for the new language detection functionality at the end of the file:Now let me run the tests to verify the implementation:I need to update the `highlightLine` function to handle the new language variants. For now, the new languages will fall back to plain text highlighting (since implementing full syntax highlighting for each is out of scope for this task - the task is just about auto-detection):Now let's run the tests again:The test for `[1, 2, 3]` is failing because a simple array doesn't pass the `looksLikeJson` heuristic. Let me fix the heuristic to be more inclusive:The issue is that `[1, 2, 3]` has no quotes so `quote_count >= 2` fails. The heuristic needs to be more sophisticated. Let me fix it:All 457 tests pass. Let me verify the specific syntax tests passed:Good - no failures. Let me now commit the changes:The implementation is complete. Here's a summary:

**Implemented: Automatic language detection for syntax highlighting**

Added to `src/renderables/syntax.zig`:

1. **Extended Language enum** with additional languages: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, Go, C, C++, Bash, YAML, TOML, XML, HTML, CSS, SQL

2. **`Language.fromExtension(ext)`** - Detects language from file extension using a comptime-generated map. Supports 40+ file extensions. Case-insensitive.

3. **`Language.fromFilename(filename)`** - Extracts extension or matches special filenames like `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `build.zig`, etc.

4. **`Language.fromContent(content)`** - Heuristic-based detection from content:
   - Shebang lines (`#!/usr/bin/env python`)
   - XML/HTML declarations
   - JSON structure detection (objects and arrays)
   - YAML front matter (`---`)
   - Markdown headings
   - Language-specific patterns (keywords, imports, function definitions)

5. **`Language.detect(filename, content)`** - Combined detection: tries filename first, falls back to content heuristics

6. **`Syntax.withAutoDetect(filename)`** - Builder method for auto-detection
7. **`Syntax.fromFile(allocator, code, filename)`** - Constructor with auto-detection

All 457 tests pass, including 22 new tests specifically for language detection.
