I'll review the recent code changes for the syntax highlighting in tracebacks task and simplify if needed.Let me read the full context of the modified file to better understand the code structure.Now let me run the tests to make sure everything is working before making any changes.Tests pass. Now let me analyze the code for potential simplifications. I see a few opportunities:

1. The `highlightSourceLine` function has an unused `is_target` parameter (marked with `_ = is_target`)
2. The check `if (seg.text.len > 0)` at line 986 is redundant since empty text segments wouldn't affect anything
3. The language detection could be simplifiedThe code-simplifier agent made some good improvements. Let me verify the changes and run the tests to confirm everything works.The simplifications look good:

1. **Removed unused `is_target` parameter** from `highlightSourceLine` - it was being immediately discarded
2. **Flattened nested conditionals** - converted nested `if` to early `continue` for cleaner flow
3. **Unified segment handling** - both branches now use the same `Segment.styled` call with the style computed beforehand
4. **Updated tests** to match the simplified function signature

Let me commit these simplification changes.Done. The simplification changes have been committed. Summary of changes:

- **Removed unused `is_target` parameter** from `highlightSourceLine` function - it was being immediately discarded with `_ = is_target`
- **Flattened nested conditionals** - converted `if (seg.text.len > 0) { ... }` to early `continue` for cleaner control flow
- **Unified segment append logic** - both target and non-target lines now use the same `Segment.styled` call, with the style computed beforehand
