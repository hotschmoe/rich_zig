I'll implement word wrap for long lines in the syntax highlighting module. Let me start by exploring the current syntax highlighting implementation.Let me continue reading the Syntax struct to understand its current structure.I see there's already a `wrapSegments` function being used. Let me find its implementation and understand what needs to be improved.I now understand the current implementation. The `wrapSegments` function exists but it does character-level wrapping (cuts at any character position). The task is to implement **word wrap** - wrapping at word boundaries instead of arbitrary character positions. Let me check if there's a cells module that might have word-related functionality.Now let me check the text.zig to see if there's any word wrap implementation there that I can learn from.I now understand the text.zig word wrap implementation. It tracks space positions and breaks at word boundaries when possible, falling back to mid-word breaks when necessary. 

Now I need to update the `wrapSegments` function in syntax.zig to do proper word wrapping instead of character-level wrapping. The current implementation just cuts at any character position; I need to make it prefer breaking at spaces/word boundaries.Now let me run the tests to see if the implementation works correctly.Let me fix the variable shadowing issue.Tests pass. Now let me also add a specific test for word wrapping to ensure the behavior is correct.Let me check the existing word wrap tests to understand the current test coverage.Good, there are already tests. Let me add a specific test that verifies word boundary wrapping explicitly to make sure my implementation works correctly.All tests pass. Let me now commit the changes.Task completed successfully.

**Summary:**
- Enhanced the `wrapSegments` function in `src/renderables/syntax.zig:1164` to implement proper word wrapping for long lines
- The function now prefers breaking at word boundaries (spaces) when possible
- Falls back to character-level wrapping only when a single word exceeds the available width
- Added a test case `"wrapSegments breaks at word boundaries"` to verify the word wrap behavior
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Changes committed with message: "feat(syntax): add word wrap for long lines"
