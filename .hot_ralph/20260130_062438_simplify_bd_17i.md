The recent commits are about syntax highlighting in tracebacks, not local variables. Let me look for the task about local variables in tracebacks.It seems the local variables in tracebacks task hasn't been committed yet. Let me check if there's an open issue or if it's in progress.I see references to bd-17i task files. Let me check those to understand what the local variables task is about.I see - the task bd-17i was analyzed and determined to be infeasible. Let me check the simplify file to see if there's any code that was written that needs review.The simplify file doesn't contain useful content - it appears to be a log file that got populated with investigation notes. Let me check if there were any actual code changes made for this task.The task bd-17i ("Show local variables in tracebacks") was analyzed and determined to be infeasible - it's explicitly out of scope in SPEC.md and technically impossible with current Zig capabilities. No code changes were made to src/ files.

There are no code changes to simplify from this task. The task investigation concluded that the feature:
1. Is explicitly marked "Out of Scope" in SPEC.md
2. Requires DWARF debug info for local variables that Zig doesn't yet emit
3. Would require implementing debugger-level memory introspection

Since no code was written, there's nothing to simplify or test. The task files in `.hot_ralph/` are just investigation notes.

Do you want me to:
1. Update the issue bd-17i status to "deferred" or "closed" since it can't be implemented?
2. Review any other recent code changes instead?
