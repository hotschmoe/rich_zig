The code-simplifier agent completed its review and made the following improvements to the unordered list implementation:

**Changes made:**

1. **Extracted `countLeadingSpaces()` helper** - Both ordered and unordered list parsers had identical indentation-counting logic that was consolidated into a single function.

2. **Extracted `renderListIndent()` helper** - Both list item renderers had identical indent-rendering code that was consolidated.

3. **Removed unused `bullet` field** - The `UnorderedListItem` struct had a `bullet` field that was parsed but never used (the theme's `list_bullet_char` is always used for rendering).

**Result:** Net reduction of 3 lines, improved DRY compliance, and all tests pass. The changes have been committed as "refactor: simplify unordered list code".
