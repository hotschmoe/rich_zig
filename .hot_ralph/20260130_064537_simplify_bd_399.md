Let me read the syntax.zig file to understand the changes made and look for simplification opportunities.Let me continue reading the file to understand the full implementation.Let me continue reading to see the tests, especially the new highlight lines tests.Let me continue reading to see the highlight lines tests.Now let me use the code-simplifier agent to review the changes and look for simplification opportunities.The code-simplifier agent has successfully simplified the code. Let me verify the changes by running the tests myself and checking the simplified code.The simplification looks good. The changes consolidated 4 helper functions down to 2 by inlining the non-highlighted versions directly into the highlighted functions. Now let me commit these changes.Done. Here's a summary of the simplification review:

## Code Simplification Complete

**Changes made to `src/renderables/syntax.zig`:**

Consolidated 4 helper functions down to 2 by inlining the non-highlighted fallback logic:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `defaultSegment()` | (removed - inlined) |
| `defaultSegmentHighlighted()` | `defaultSegmentHighlighted()` |
| `styledSegment()` | (removed - inlined) |
| `styledSegmentHighlighted()` | `styledSegmentHighlighted()` |

**Result:** -14 lines, +5 lines (net reduction of 9 lines)

**Benefits:**
- Eliminated unnecessary indirection
- Each remaining function is self-contained with clear purpose
- All 70+ tests pass, confirming functionality is preserved

**Commit:** `c6c8329` - "refactor(syntax): simplify highlight line helper functions"
