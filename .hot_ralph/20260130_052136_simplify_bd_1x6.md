The code-simplifier agent completed the review and made two simplifications to the task list rendering code in `src/renderables/markdown.zig`:

1. **Consolidated duplicate checkbox parsing logic** - Combined two separate if-branches for checked/unchecked checkboxes into a single conditional expression, eliminating ~10 lines of duplicated code.

2. **Combined switch statements for marker rendering** - Used Zig's tuple unpacking to extract both the marker character and style in one switch expression, unifying the rendering path.

Both changes reduce code duplication while preserving exact functionality. All tests pass.

Let me commit these simplifications.Good simplifications. Let me run the tests once more to confirm everything works, then commit.Done. The code simplification is complete:

**Changes made to `src/renderables/markdown.zig`:**

1. **Checkbox parsing (lines 543-561)**: Consolidated two separate if-branches for checked/unchecked checkboxes into a single conditional expression that determines the checkbox state, followed by one shared code path.

2. **Marker rendering (lines 613-619)**: Combined two separate switch statements into a single destructuring assignment using Zig's tuple unpacking to extract both marker character and style in one expression.

**Result**: Removed 10 lines of duplicate code while preserving exact functionality. All tests pass.
