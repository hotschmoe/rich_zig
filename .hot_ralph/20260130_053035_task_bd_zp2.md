I'll implement input prompts for user input in the Console. Let me first explore the existing codebase to understand the current console implementation and patterns.The exploration reveals that Console already has basic input functionality. Let me read the current implementation to understand what's there and what needs to be added.I can see there's already a basic input implementation in console.zig. Now let me check the SPEC.md more closely about what "Input prompts" means in the "Deferred (Post-1.0)" section.The spec mentions "Input prompts" as deferred with the note "Requires input handling subsystem". Looking at the current implementation, there's basic line-based input via `readUntilDelimiterOrEof`, but the spec indicates more sophisticated interactive input is needed - like raw mode handling for features such as:
- Password masking (hiding input as typed)
- Character-by-character input  
- Arrow key navigation
- Interactive editing

Let me check what Python Rich's Prompt module offers to understand the full feature set expected.Now let me look at what rich_rust implements for prompts.Now I have a good understanding. Let me check the existing console implementation more thoroughly and see what additional features are needed for a proper input prompt system.Let me also look at the renderables module structure to understand how to add a new component properly.Now let me check the root.zig to see the public API and understand what's exported.Now let me check if there's terminal raw mode support available since input prompts need to be able to read individual characters for password masking.Raw mode isn't implemented yet. Now let me create the prompt module. Based on Python Rich's Prompt module, I need to implement:

1. `Prompt` - Text input with markup support
2. `IntPrompt` - Integer input with bounds
3. `FloatPrompt` - Float input with bounds  
4. `Confirm` - Yes/no confirmation

Since the existing console.zig already has basic input functionality, I'll create a dedicated prompt module that provides the more advanced features like choices, typed prompts, and proper password masking.Now I need to add a helper method `printSegmentDirect` to the Console for the prompt module to use. Let me check if it already exists or needs to be added.The `printSegment` is private. I need to add a public method or modify my approach. Let me check console.zig more closely around that method and see how to best integrate.I see `printSegment` is private but `printSegments` is public. Let me modify my prompt implementation to use `printSegments` instead or write directly to stdout since the prompt doesn't need capture support. Actually, looking at the code, I think it's simpler to just write the styled output directly to stdout in the prompt module, similar to how validation errors are written.

Let me update the prompt module to avoid depending on internal Console methods:Now let me search for `renderAnsi` to understand how styles render to ANSI codes:I see the Style can render directly to a writer with `renderAnsi`. Let me update my prompt implementation to write styled output properly. Instead of relying on Console.printSegmentDirect (which doesn't exist), I'll render the segments directly using Style.renderAnsi:Now I need to update the prompt rendering to properly output styled segments. Let me update the Prompt.ask function:Now I need to add the helper functions and fix the other prompts similarly. Let me rewrite the file more carefully with the complete implementation:Now let me update root.zig to export the prompt module:Now let me add the prompt module to the test section in root.zig:Now let me run the tests to see if the code compiles correctly:The test command ran but didn't show any output. Let me check the exit code:All tests pass. Now let me update the todo list and update SPEC.md to reflect that input prompts are now implemented:Now let me update SPEC.md to reflect that input prompts are now implemented:Now let me check if there's a feature parity or another section that should be updated to mark input prompts as done:Now let me check if FEATURE_PARITY.md exists and needs updating:Let me update the todo list and run a final test build:All tests pass and the build succeeds. Now let me commit the changes:**Task completed successfully.**

I implemented input prompts for user input in the rich_zig library. Here's what was added:

## New Module: `src/prompt.zig`

### Prompt Types
1. **`Prompt`** - Text input with rich features:
   - Markup support in prompt text (`[bold red]Name[/]`)
   - Choice validation with case sensitivity option
   - Default values
   - Password masking (raw terminal mode on POSIX/Windows)
   - Custom validator functions

2. **`IntPrompt`** - Integer input:
   - Min/max bounds validation
   - Default value support

3. **`FloatPrompt`** - Float input:
   - Min/max bounds validation
   - Default value support

4. **`Confirm`** - Yes/no confirmation:
   - Accepts y/yes/true/1 and n/no/false/0
   - Default value displayed as Y/n or y/N

### API Pattern
All prompts use the builder pattern:
```zig
const name = try Prompt.init(allocator, "[bold]Enter name[/]")
    .withDefault("John")
    .withChoices(&.{"John", "Jane", "Bob"})
    .caseSensitive(false)
    .ask();
defer allocator.free(name);

const age = try IntPrompt.init(allocator, "Age")
    .withMin(0)
    .withMax(150)
    .withDefault(25)
    .ask();

const proceed = try Confirm.init(allocator, "Continue?")
    .withDefault(true)
    .ask();
```

### Password Masking
Password input uses terminal raw mode to:
- Disable echo
- Display asterisks as user types
- Support backspace
- Cross-platform (POSIX termios / Windows Console API)
