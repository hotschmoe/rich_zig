I'll review the recent code changes for the logging formatted tracebacks feature and simplify as needed.Now let me also look at the changes to root.zig:Let me analyze the code for simplification opportunities. I'll look at specific areas that could be cleaned up:Good, tests pass. Now let me identify simplification opportunities in the traceback code:

**Issues I found:**

1. `StackFrame.format` - Uses `std.ArrayList(u8).empty` pattern incorrectly - initializing `var result` and then calling `.writer(allocator)` but `ArrayList.empty` doesn't have `writer` method that takes allocator
2. `parseZigFrameLine` - The `_: *Traceback` parameter shows it's unused (takes `self` but doesn't use it)
3. `renderFrame` - Has unused `_: usize` parameter (inner_width)
4. `parseFileLocation` - Could be a standalone function since it doesn't use `self`
5. Several places create strings with `try allocator.dupe(u8, ...)` that could be simplified
6. `line_num_width` is computed but never used in `renderSourceContext`

Let me fix these issues:Now let me remove the unused `line_num_width` variable:Now let me also make `parseFileLocation` a standalone function since it doesn't use `self`:The `parseFileLocation` function is already a static method that doesn't use `self`. Good. Let me check if it's being used with `Traceback.` prefix or just the function name:Good, both callers are already using it without `self.` prefix. Now let me also check if the `.empty` pattern being used elsewhere needs fixing:I see `.empty` patterns. Let me check how these are being used - the `.empty` field in Zig 0.15 `ArrayList` should work, but they need allocator on methods. Let me verify by reading the usages:I see these ArrayList usages with `.empty` are using the new pattern in Zig 0.15 where `append`, `toOwnedSlice`, `deinit` take allocator as a parameter. This is the managed ArrayList pattern. These look correct.

However, I notice `inner_width` is computed but no longer used after my edit. Let me check:It's now unused. Let me remove it:Now let me run the tests to verify these simplifications don't break anything:The Zig 0.15 ArrayList API changed. Let me look at how ArrayLists are typically initialized in this codebase:I see the pattern used is `.empty` not `.init(allocator)`. The managed ArrayList API in Zig 0.15 uses `.empty` and then passes allocator to each method. Let me revert my `StackFrame.format` change:Tests pass. Let me now view the summary of simplifications I made:Now let me commit these simplification changes:Done. I reviewed and simplified the traceback code from the recent commit. The changes made:

**Simplifications applied:**
1. Removed unused `inner_width` variable from `Traceback.render()`
2. Removed unused `_: usize` parameter from `renderFrame()` 
3. Removed unused `line_num_width` computation in `renderSourceContext()`
4. Made `parseZigFrameLine` a static function (it had an unused `_: *Traceback` self parameter)
5. Changed `var writer` to `const writer` in `StackFrame.format()` since it's never reassigned

All tests pass. The commit removed 15 lines of dead/unused code while preserving all functionality.
