I'll implement Markdown image support that shows alt text. Let me first explore the codebase to understand the existing Markdown rendering implementation.Now let me read the markdown.zig file to see how images are currently handled and what needs to be implemented.The image support is already fully implemented in the markdown.zig file. Let me verify this by reading the relevant sections to understand the current implementation.The Markdown image support is already fully implemented. Let me verify by running the tests to confirm everything works correctly.All 637 tests pass. Let me run the specific markdown image tests to confirm they're working.Let me verify the image tests exist and are comprehensive by checking them directly.The image support is fully implemented with comprehensive tests. The implementation:

1. **Parses image syntax**: `![alt text](url)` 
2. **Displays alt text**: Shows as `[Image: alt text]` with italic styling
3. **Falls back to URL**: If no alt text is provided (`![](url)`), displays the URL instead
4. **Themeable**: `MarkdownTheme` has `image_style`, `image_prefix`, and `image_suffix` fields
5. **Works in all contexts**: List items, blockquotes, inline with other styles

The feature is complete. Since this task is asking to implement "Markdown: Images (show alt text)" and it's already fully implemented with 15+ tests covering all edge cases, this is a case where the work is already done.

Let me verify once more by checking the FEATURE_PARITY.md to see if this needs to be marked as complete there.The feature "Images (alt text)" is already marked as complete (`[x]`) in the FEATURE_PARITY.md at line 353.

**Summary**: The task "Markdown: Images (show alt text)" is already fully implemented:

1. **Implementation** (in `src/renderables/markdown.zig`):
   - Image parsing: `tryParseImage()` parses `![alt](url)` syntax
   - Rendering: Images display as `[Image: alt text]` with configurable styling
   - Fallback: Empty alt text shows the URL instead
   - Theme support: `MarkdownTheme.image_style`, `image_prefix`, `image_suffix`

2. **Tests** (15+ tests covering):
   - Basic parsing
   - Empty alt text
   - Invalid syntax handling
   - Nested brackets/parens
   - Images in lists, blockquotes
   - Multiple images
   - Combination with other inline styles

3. **Documentation**: Already marked complete in `docs/FEATURE_PARITY.md`

There is no additional work required for this task. The feature is complete and all tests pass.
