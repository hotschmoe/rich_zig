I'll implement SVG export for the console. Let me start by exploring the existing codebase to understand the console structure and how it handles rendering.Now let me look at the existing `exportHtml` method as a reference, and also check Python Rich's `export_svg` API.Now let me check the Python Rich source code for more implementation details.Let me also check the style.zig to understand how colors work in this codebase.Now let me check the Color module for the RGB conversion we need for SVG.Now let me also check cells.zig for cell width calculation which is needed for proper layout.I have enough context now. Let me update the todos and implement the SVG export feature.Now I'll implement the `exportSvg` method. Based on the Python Rich API design and the existing `exportHtml` method, I'll create an SVG export that:
1. Renders terminal output with styled text as SVG
2. Supports colors, font styles, and layout
3. Includes terminal "chrome" (window decorations)
4. Has configurable options for title, font, dimensionsNow let me add the `exportSvg` function and supporting types. I'll add it after the `exportHtml` function.Now let me run the tests to validate the implementation.All tests pass. Let me also run a quick verification to see the actual SVG output.All 6 new SVG export tests pass (tests 13-18). Let me now update the todos and commit.**Task completed successfully.**

I implemented `Console.exportSvg()` in `src/console.zig` with the following features:

**API Design** (modeled after Python Rich's export_svg):
- `SvgOptions` struct with configurable parameters:
  - `title` - Optional window title
  - `font_family` - Default "Fira Code,Monaco,Consolas,Liberation Mono,monospace"
  - `font_size` - Default 14px
  - `line_height` - Default 1.4
  - `font_aspect_ratio` - Default 0.61 (standard for Fira Code)
  - `background_color` / `foreground_color` - Dracula theme defaults
  - `padding` - Default 20px
  - `chrome` - Toggle terminal window decorations
  - `chrome_color` - Title bar color
  - `term_width` - Override terminal width

**Features**:
- Renders styled segments as SVG with proper layout
- Supports colors (converts all color types to RGB)
- Supports text attributes (bold, dim, italic, underline, strike, overline)
- Auto-calculates dimensions based on content
- Terminal chrome with rounded corners and traffic light buttons (red/yellow/green)
- XML-safe text escaping
- Unicode-aware cell width calculation for proper character positioning

**Tests added** (all passing):
- Plain text export
- Styled text export
- XML escaping
- Title rendering
- Multiple lines
- Color rendering
