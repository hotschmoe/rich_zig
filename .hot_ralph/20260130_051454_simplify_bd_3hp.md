I'll review the recent code changes for the GFM tables feature and use the code-simplifier agent to refine the code.The code-simplifier agent has completed its review and made several improvements. Here's a summary:

## Code Simplifications Made

**File: `src/renderables/markdown.zig`**

| Function | Change | Lines Saved |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `isTableRow` | Removed redundant pipe check, switched to `indexOfScalar` | ~3 |
| `isTableSeparator` | Merged two loops into single pass with switch | ~6 |
| `splitTableCells` | Chained `trim` calls instead of manual pipe stripping | ~5 |
| `emitTable` | Consolidated duplicate fallback logic | ~10 |

**Total reduction:** ~30 lines while preserving all functionality.

All 550 tests pass after the simplifications.

Let me commit these changes.The changes look good. Let me commit them.Committed the simplifications. The code-simplifier agent reduced 41 lines to 10 lines (net -31 lines) while preserving all functionality. Key improvements:

| Function | Simplification |
|----------|---------------|
| `isTableRow` | Single `indexOfScalar` check instead of redundant conditions |
| `isTableSeparator` | Single loop with switch instead of two separate loops |
| `splitTableCells` | Chained `trim` calls instead of manual pipe-stripping |
| `emitTable` | Single validity check with unified fallback path |
