I'll implement ordered list rendering in the markdown renderer. Let me first explore the current state of the markdown.zig file to understand the existing structure.Now I have a good understanding of the markdown renderer. I need to implement ordered list rendering. Let me also look at how unordered lists might be structured (if they exist) or how similar list-like patterns are handled:No unordered list support exists yet. Let me check the MarkdownTheme to see if there's any list styling already:Now I understand the structure. I need to:
1. Add an `ordered_list_style` to `MarkdownTheme`
2. Add parsing logic in `Markdown.render` to detect ordered list lines (e.g., `1.`, `2.`, etc.)
3. Render them with proper indentation

Let me implement this. I'll add the ordered list support:Now I need to add the ordered list parsing and rendering logic. I'll add a helper function to parse ordered list items and integrate it into the main render function:Now I need to integrate the ordered list parsing into the main render function. Let me update the render loop to handle ordered lists:Now I need to add the `renderOrderedListItem` helper function. Let me add it after the `parseOrderedListItem` function:Now let me add tests for the ordered list functionality. I'll add them at the end of the test section:Now let me run the tests to verify the implementation:All 384 tests pass. Let me also run the markdown-specific tests to make sure they all pass:All tests pass. Now let me create the commit:Task completed successfully.

**Summary:**
Implemented ordered list rendering in `src/renderables/markdown.zig`:

1. **Added theme properties** (lines 47-48):
   - `list_number_style`: Style for list numbers (bright yellow)
   - `list_indent`: Spaces per indent level (default 3)

2. **Added `OrderedListItem` struct** (lines 316-320):
   - Stores number, text content, and indent level

3. **Added `parseOrderedListItem` function** (lines 322-358):
   - Detects ordered list patterns: `1.` or `1)` followed by space
   - Handles indentation via leading spaces (2 spaces = 1 indent level)
   - Returns structured item for rendering

4. **Added `renderOrderedListItem` function** (lines 360-382):
   - Renders proper indentation based on nesting level
   - Applies styled number prefix
   - Supports inline formatting (bold, italic, links) in item text

5. **Integrated into main render loop** (lines 257-259):
   - Ordered lists are parsed after headers but before plain text

6. **Added comprehensive tests** (12 new tests):
   - Parsing basic items, various numbers, paren delimiters
   - Indentation handling, invalid input rejection
   - Full rendering with inline styles and nesting
   - Theme configuration verification

All 384 tests pass.
