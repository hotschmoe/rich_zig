I'll review the recent code changes for the Markdown Links feature and simplify if needed. Let me start by examining what was changed.Now let me read the full markdown.zig file to understand the context better and identify potential simplifications.Now let me analyze the code for potential simplifications. Looking at the new link-related code:

1. **`tryParseLink` function (lines 399-442)**: The logic is clear but the two bracket/paren scanning loops are nearly identical. This could potentially be factored out.

2. **`InlineSpan` struct**: The `link_url` field is only used for `.link` style_type - this is fine for extensibility.

3. **`renderInlineText` link handling (lines 526-532)**: Uses a labeled block which is reasonable given the structure.

Let me check if there's a cleaner way to factor the nested bracket/paren scanning:Good analysis. The helper function approach is clean and reduces duplication meaningfully. Let me apply this simplification.Now let me run the tests to ensure the refactoring didn't break anything.All tests pass. Let me also run with release optimization to make sure.Tests pass. Now let me commit this simplification.Done. I reviewed the Markdown Links implementation and applied one simplification:

**Change made**: Extracted a `findMatchingDelimiter` helper function from `tryParseLink`. The original implementation had two nearly identical loops for scanning nested brackets `[]` and nested parentheses `()`. The helper consolidates this pattern, reducing `tryParseLink` from 28 lines to 11 lines while improving readability.

**Summary**:
- `-29 lines`, `+20 lines` (net reduction of 9 lines)
- All tests pass (including ReleaseSafe optimization)
- Committed as `c770157`
