I'll review the code changes made for the logging task and simplify them if needed.I see the recent commits. The logging-related changes were made a few commits ago. Let me look at what files were modified for the logging task specifically.The logging module was already simplified. Let me check the current state and see if there's any further simplification needed.The logging module looks well-structured. Let me run the tests to make sure everything is working correctly, and then I'll analyze if there are any simplifications that can be made.Tests pass. Let me analyze the logging module for potential simplifications.Looking at the code, I've identified a few simplification opportunities:

1. **Line 135**: `std.fs.File.stdout().writer(buffer)` - This creates a buffered writer but the API is unusual. Let me check if this is the correct pattern.The code compiles. Let me check how the writer is used and if there are any issues with the current implementation.Let me look at how console.zig uses it for comparison.I see the pattern - `std.fs.File.Writer` has an `interface` field that needs to be accessed for the actual writing. Looking at the logging code again:

```zig
const writer = &self.writer.interface;  // line 163
```

This is consistent with the console.zig pattern. Let me look for any other simplification opportunities.

Looking at the code more carefully:

1. **Lines 238-240** - The padding loop could use `@memset` or `writeByteNTimes` if available
2. **Lines 269-276** - The `writeMessage` function checks `isEmpty()` twice which is slightly redundant

Let me check if there's a simpler way to write multiple spaces:I see `writeByteNTimes` is available. Let me simplify the padding loop in `writeLevel`. I'll also look for a way to simplify the `writeMessage` function.Now let me simplify the `writeMessage` function to avoid the double check:Tests pass. Let me also run the build to ensure everything compiles correctly:The `Io.Writer` interface doesn't have `writeByteNTimes`. Let me check what methods are available on the writer interface and use a different approach:Let me check what type of writer is used in console.zig at line 107:I see - in console.zig it's using a different type of writer. The issue is that in logging.zig we're passing `writer: anytype` which is the `Io.Writer` interface, not the `std.fs.File.Writer`. Let me revert to the loop approach which works with any writer:Both tests and build pass. Let me update the todo list and commit the changes:Good changes - the diff shows two simplifications:

1. **writeLevel padding**: Replaced 5-line conditional with a single-line range-based for loop (the range `written_len..target_width` is empty if `written_len >= target_width`, so no conditional needed)

2. **writeMessage**: Cached the `isEmpty()` check to avoid calling it twice

Let me commit these changes:Done. I reviewed and simplified the logging module with two changes:

1. **writeLevel padding** (`src/logging.zig:236`): Replaced a 5-line conditional block with a single-line range-based for loop. The range `written_len..target_width` is naturally empty when no padding is needed, eliminating the explicit conditional check.

2. **writeMessage** (`src/logging.zig:264-267`): Cached the `isEmpty()` result in a local variable to avoid calling it twice.

Both tests and build pass. The commit reduces the file by 8 lines while preserving all functionality.
