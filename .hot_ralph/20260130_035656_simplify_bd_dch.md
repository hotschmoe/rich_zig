I'll review the recent code changes for the "Progress: Add custom columns" task and simplify them if needed.Let me read the full progress.zig file to understand the context better and identify simplification opportunities.Now I have a good understanding of the code. Let me identify simplification opportunities in the new custom columns code.Based on my review, I've identified several simplification opportunities:

1. **`applyStyle` has an unused allocator parameter** (line 1020-1032) - the `_ = allocator` line is a dead giveaway
2. **Repeated pattern for styled/plain segments** - The pattern `if (self.style.isEmpty()) Segment.plain(x) else Segment.styled(x, self.style)` appears many times in `renderBuiltin`. This could be extracted to a helper.
3. **`render` method returns empty array for hidden columns** - Could return `&.{}` instead of allocating

Let me apply these simplifications.Now let me simplify the `renderBuiltin` function to use the new `styledSegment` helper.Now let me also simplify the `Progress.render` method - it can also return an empty slice literal instead of allocating.Now let me run the tests to verify nothing broke.The parameter `text` shadows the `text` function. Let me rename the parameter.All tests pass. Let me also run with optimization to ensure the code is solid.All tests pass. Let me view the simplified code to show the changes made.Now let me commit these simplification changes.I've reviewed and simplified the custom columns code in `progress.zig`. Here's a summary of the changes:

**Simplifications applied:**

1. **Extracted `styledSegment` helper** - The repeated pattern `if (self.style.isEmpty()) Segment.plain(x) else Segment.styled(x, self.style)` appeared 9 times. Now it's a single 1-line helper function.

2. **Simplified `applyStyle`** - Removed the unused `allocator` parameter and changed return type from `![]Segment` to `void` since it mutates in place.

3. **Use empty slice literals** - Changed `try allocator.alloc(Segment, 0)` to `&.{}` in two places (hidden column render and empty Progress render).

**Result:** Net reduction of 34 lines (-54 insertions, +20 deletions) while preserving all functionality. All tests pass in both Debug and ReleaseSafe modes.
