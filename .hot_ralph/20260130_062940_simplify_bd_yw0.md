The code-simplifier agent completed the review and made two simplifications to `src/renderables/syntax.zig`:

1. **Removed a verbose comment** in `highlightLine` - the explanation about memory management was redundant since `expandTabs` already documents its behavior.

2. **Replaced manual tab counting loop with `std.mem.count`** - used the standard library function instead of a hand-rolled loop, combined the early-return check with the count result, and fixed the variable name from `result_len` to `max_len` to accurately reflect it's an upper bound.

All tests pass. The changes removed 8 lines while preserving all functionality. Would you like me to commit these simplifications?
