I'll review the recent changes for the blockquote implementation and run the code-simplifier agent to analyze and potentially simplify the code.Now let me run the code-simplifier agent to analyze the blockquote implementation.The code-simplifier agent found and made improvements to the blockquote implementation. Let me verify the tests pass and then commit the changes.The changes look good. Let me commit these simplifications.The code simplification is complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

**Simplifications to blockquote implementation:**

1. **`parseBlockquote` function** - Reduced from 21 lines to 14 lines:
   - Combined bounds check and character check into a single early-break condition
   - Simplified `if (pos < line.len) line[pos..] else ""` to just `line[pos..]` (Zig slices at end return empty slice)
   - Removed comments describing obvious operations

2. **`renderBlockquoteLine` function** - Removed 3 comments that restated what the code clearly showed

All tests pass, confirming functionality is preserved. Committed as `12828b0`.
