I'll review the recent code changes for the ordered list implementation and use the code-simplifier agent to refine them.Let me look at the actual changes made to markdown.zig.Now I have a good understanding of the changes. Let me run the code-simplifier agent to review and potentially simplify this code.The simplifier made changes. Let me verify the tests pass and review what was changed.Tests pass and the simplifications look good. The changes are:

1. **Used idiomatic Zig while loops** with increment in continuation: `while (cond) : (incr) {}`
2. **Used `std.ascii.isDigit()`** instead of manual character range check
3. **Combined two null checks** into one condition
4. **Removed redundant comments** that described obvious code behavior
5. **Computed `indent_level` inline** in the return statement instead of a separate variable

These changes follow the codebase's style of minimal comments and idiomatic Zig patterns. Let me commit these simplifications.Good. The simplifications are clean and focused. Now I'll commit these changes.Code simplification complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Summary

**Reviewed**: The ordered list implementation in `src/renderables/markdown.zig` (255 lines added)

**Simplifications made** (net -15 lines):

1. **Idiomatic while loops**: Changed `while (cond) { i += 1; }` to `while (cond) : (i += 1) {}`
2. **Standard library usage**: Replaced manual `>= '0' and <= '9'` with `std.ascii.isDigit()`
3. **Combined null checks**: Merged `if (x == 0) return null; if (y) return null;` into single condition
4. **Removed verbose comments**: Comments like "Count leading spaces for indentation" were removed since the code is self-explanatory
5. **Inline computation**: Computed `indent_level` directly in the return statement instead of using an intermediate variable

**Tests**: All tests pass after simplifications.

**Commit**: `e1a462d` - refactor: simplify ordered list parsing code
