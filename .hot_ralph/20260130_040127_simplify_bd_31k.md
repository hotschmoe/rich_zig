I'll review the recent code changes for the Syntax `loadFile` feature and run the code-simplifier agent to clean up the code.The code-simplifier agent made excellent improvements to the Syntax code. Let me verify the changes and run tests to confirm everything works.Tests pass. Let me view the actual diff to see the simplifications:The simplifications are clean and correct. Let me commit these changes:Done. The code-simplifier made these improvements to `src/renderables/syntax.zig`:

1. **Added `owns_code` field** - Tracks whether the Syntax instance owns its code memory, preventing potential double-free bugs if `deinit()` is called on instances created via `init()` or `fromFile()`

2. **Simplified file reading** - Replaced manual `stat()` + `alloc()` + `readAll()` with idiomatic `readToEndAlloc()`

3. **Better language detection** - Changed from `Language.fromFilename()` to `Language.detect()` which tries filename detection first, then falls back to content-based heuristics

4. **Improved documentation** - Clarified that `deinit()` should only be called on `loadFile()` instances

All tests pass and the changes have been committed.
