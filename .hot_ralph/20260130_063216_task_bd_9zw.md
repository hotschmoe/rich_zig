I'll implement indent guides for the syntax highlighter. Let me first understand the current implementation.Now I understand the syntax highlighter structure. I need to add indent guides - vertical lines at indent levels. Let me plan the implementation:Now I need to add the indent_guides field to the Syntax struct and the builder method:Now add the builder method after `withTabSize`:Now I need to implement the indent guide rendering. The approach is to:
1. After highlighting a line, process the leading whitespace and insert guide characters at tab stops
2. Replace spaces at indent levels with the guide character followed by spaces

Let me add a helper function to apply indent guides and integrate it into the render method:Now add the `renderWithIndentGuides` function. I'll add it before `highlightLine`:Now I'll add the `renderWithIndentGuides` function after `highlightLine`:Now let me add tests for the indent guides feature. I'll add them at the end of the file before the last test:Now let me run the tests to validate the implementation:All tests pass. Let me run the tests again with verbose output to confirm the new tests are being executed:All 625 tests pass. Let me also run the syntax tests specifically to make sure all the new indent guide tests pass:That's expected because of the module path structure. The main test works. Let me verify by checking the test count for the syntax tests in the build:All tests pass. Now let me commit the changes:**Success.** The indent guides feature has been implemented and committed.

## Summary

Added visual indentation guides to the syntax highlighter in `src/renderables/syntax.zig`:

**New fields:**
- `indent_guides: bool = false` - enables indent guide rendering
- `indent_guide_char: []const u8 = "|"` - customizable guide character

**New builder methods:**
- `withIndentGuides()` - enable indent guides
- `withIndentGuideChar(char)` - set custom guide character

**New theme property:**
- `SyntaxTheme.indent_guide_style` - style for guide characters (dim by default)

**Implementation:**
- `renderWithIndentGuides()` - renders a line with vertical guide characters at each tab stop in leading whitespace, then delegates syntax highlighting for the code content

**Tests added:**
- 8 new tests covering: builder methods, no indentation, single/multiple indent levels, custom characters, syntax highlighting preservation, partial indents, and multiline code
