I'll implement a rich log handler with styled output, timestamps, log levels, and colors. Let me first explore the existing codebase to understand the patterns and dependencies.I see that `logging.zig` is already imported in `root.zig`. Let me check if it exists and what's already there.The `logging.zig` module already exists and is fully implemented with:

1. **Log levels** (`Level` enum) - debug, info, warn, err with string conversion and std.log compatibility
2. **LevelStyles** - Customizable styles for each log level with sensible defaults
3. **FormatOptions** - Options for timestamp format, showing path/level, alignment
4. **LogRecord** - Log entry with metadata (level, message, timestamp, path, line)
5. **RichHandler** - Main handler with emit, convenience methods (debug/info/warn/err)
6. **stdLogFn** - Compatible with std.log for use with `pub const std_options`
7. **scopedLog** - Creates scoped loggers

Let me verify the tests pass and check if there are any issues.Tests pass. The logging module is already fully implemented with all required features:

1. **Styled log output** - Levels have distinct colors (debug=dim, info=blue, warn=yellow+bold, err=red+bold)
2. **Timestamps** - Three formats: time_only (HH:MM:SS), datetime (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS), iso8601
3. **Log levels** - debug, info, warn, err with filtering via `setMinLevel`
4. **Colors** - Full color support with automatic terminal detection and downgrading

Let me verify the module is properly integrated and check git status.The logging module is already fully implemented and integrated. There are no uncommitted changes related to the logging module - it was already committed previously.The task is complete. The **logging module** (`src/logging.zig`) is already fully implemented with:

**Features:**
- **Level enum** - debug, info, warn, err with std.log.Level compatibility
- **LevelStyles** - Customizable per-level styling (dim debug, blue info, yellow+bold warn, red+bold err)
- **FormatOptions** - Timestamp format (time_only, datetime, iso8601), show/hide path/level
- **LogRecord** - Log entry with level, message, timestamp, optional path/line
- **RichHandler** - Main handler with emit(), convenience methods (debug/info/warn/err)
- **stdLogFn** - Drop-in replacement for std.log.logFn
- **scopedLog** - Creates scoped loggers

**Tests:** 12 unit tests covering Level conversions, LevelStyles, LogRecord, RichHandler, and FormatOptions.

**Exports in root.zig:**
- `RichHandler`, `LogRecord`, `LevelStyles`

No commit needed - the implementation was already committed previously.
