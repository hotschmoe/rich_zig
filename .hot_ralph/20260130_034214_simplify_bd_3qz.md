I'll start by examining the recent code changes for the word wrap support task, then use the code-simplifier agent to review and potentially simplify the code.Now I have a good understanding of the changes. Let me run the code-simplifier agent to review and simplify this code.The code-simplifier agent has completed its review and made improvements. Let me verify the changes by checking the current state.All tests pass. Here's a summary of the simplification work completed:

## Summary

The code-simplifier agent reviewed and improved the word wrap implementation in `src/renderables/syntax.zig`. The changes have been committed as `3a7ebfa refactor: simplify code from bd-3qz`.

### Key Improvements

**1. Render function word wrap handling:**
- Renamed `is_continuation` to `after_wrap_newline` for clarity
- Removed nested if/else branching - now always appends the segment
- Consolidated the newline check into a single boolean variable

**2. `wrapSegments` function:**
- Changed loop condition from tracking `remaining_width` to using `remaining_text.len > 0` directly
- Moved width calculation inline where needed instead of maintaining a separate variable
- Removed redundant comments that described obvious code
- Reduced function from 51 lines to 39 lines

**3. General cleanup:**
- Removed comments that restated what the code does
- Kept the docstring on `wrapSegments` but removed the redundant second line

All 117 tests continue to pass, confirming no behavior changes were introduced.
