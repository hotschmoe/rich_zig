I'll review the recent code changes for the "Syntax: Add indent guides" task and use the code-simplifier agent to refine it.Now let me read the modified syntax.zig file to understand the changes, then launch the code-simplifier agent.I can see the changes. Let me launch the code-simplifier agent to review and potentially simplify this code.The code-simplifier agent successfully simplified the indent guides code. Here's what was done:

## Simplifications Made

**Main improvement: Eliminated code duplication**

The original implementation had the same 15+ case language switch statement duplicated in two places (`highlightLine` and `renderWithIndentGuides`). The agent extracted a shared `highlightContent` helper function, resulting in:

- **-25 net lines** (14 added, 39 removed)
- Single source of truth for language-specific highlighting
- Cleaner control flow with if/else instead of early return
- Simplified variable naming
- Removed redundant comments

**All 50+ tests pass**, confirming the functionality is preserved.

The changes have been committed. Let me verify the commit:The simplification has been committed as `ce57665`. The refactoring extracts a `highlightContent` helper function that is now shared between normal rendering and indent-guides rendering, eliminating the duplicated language switch statement.
