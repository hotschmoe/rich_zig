I'll start by examining the recent code changes for the markdown inline code task, then use the code-simplifier agent to review and potentially simplify the code.Now I have a clear picture of the changes. Let me run the code-simplifier agent to review and potentially simplify this code.The code-simplifier agent has completed its work. The key improvement was reusing the existing `isRepeatedChar` helper function instead of reimplementing the same logic manually.

Let me verify the tests pass and check the simplified code:All tests pass. The simplification is clean and effective:

**Changes made:**
1. Replaced manual backtick matching loop with existing `isRepeatedChar` helper function
2. Removed redundant `match` variable and inner loop
3. Consolidated comments - the code is now self-documenting
4. Reused `after_pos` variable in the return statement instead of recalculating

The code went from 43 lines to 28 lines while preserving all functionality. Let me commit these changes:Done. The simplification is complete and committed.

**Summary:**
- Reviewed the inline code rendering implementation from commit cdbd808
- Simplified `tryParseInlineCode` by reusing the existing `isRepeatedChar` helper function
- Removed 14 lines of redundant code (manual loop with boolean flag)
- All 427 tests pass, confirming functionality is preserved
- Committed as bcf628e
