I'll implement unordered list rendering for the Markdown renderer. Let me start by exploring the current state of the markdown.zig file.Now I understand the structure. The markdown renderer already has:
- Headers
- Inline styles (bold, italic, links)
- Code blocks
- Ordered lists

I need to add unordered list support. Let me look at how rich_rust or similar libraries handle unordered lists to understand the expected behavior, and check the existing ordered list implementation as a reference.

The pattern is clear from the ordered list implementation:
1. Parse the line to detect if it's a list item
2. Extract indent level, bullet character, and text
3. Render with appropriate indentation and styling

Let me implement unordered list support:Now I'll add the UnorderedListItem struct and parser, placing it near the OrderedListItem:Now add the parser function after `parseOrderedListItem`:Now integrate into the main render loop. I need to add unordered list detection in the render function:Now let me add tests at the end of the file. First, let me read the end of the file to see where to add tests:Now I'll add tests for unordered lists at the end of the file:Now let me run the tests to verify the implementation:Tests pass. Let me also run the tests with a filter to specifically see the markdown tests:Tests pass successfully. Let me verify the tests run correctly by running with verbose output:All 394 tests pass. Let me update the todo list and commit:Now let me create the commit:Task completed successfully.

## Summary

Implemented unordered list rendering for the Markdown renderer in `src/renderables/markdown.zig`:

**Changes made:**
1. Added `list_bullet_style` and `list_bullet_char` to `MarkdownTheme` for configurable bullet styling
2. Added `UnorderedListItem` struct to hold parsed list item data (text, indent level, original bullet character)
3. Implemented `parseUnorderedListItem()` to detect `-`, `*`, or `+` bullet markers with proper spacing
4. Implemented `renderUnorderedListItem()` to render bullets with indentation and styled bullet character
5. Integrated unordered list parsing into the main `render()` loop
6. Added comprehensive tests for parsing and rendering

**Features:**
- Supports `-`, `*`, and `+` as bullet markers (CommonMark standard)
- Proper indentation support (2 spaces per nesting level)
- Configurable bullet character (defaults to Unicode bullet point)
- Inline styles work within list items (bold, italic, links)
- Integrates with existing ordered list and header rendering
