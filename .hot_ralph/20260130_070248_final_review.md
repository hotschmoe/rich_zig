I've already read VISION.md. Let me now explore the codebase to assess how well it embodies the stated vision.## Summary: rich_zig vs. VISION.md

The codebase **strongly embodies the stated vision**. Here's the assessment:

### What Was Built

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Core Types** (Phase 1) | 100% | color, style, segment, cells - all with comptime optimization |
| **Text/Markup** (Phase 2) | 100% | BBCode parser, spans, wrapping, alignment |
| **Terminal/Console** (Phase 3) | 100% | Detection, paging, logging, prompts, export |
| **Renderables** (Phase 4) | 100% | Panel, Table, Tree, Progress, Layout, Rule, Columns, etc. |
| **Optional** (Phase 5) | 90% | JSON, Syntax, Markdown, Emoji, Logging |

**168 features tracked in FEATURE_PARITY.md** - all marked complete.

### Design Principles Adherence

| Principle | Grade | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Zero External Dependencies | **A+** | `build.zig.zon` has empty dependencies |
| Explicit Allocators | **A+** | Every public API takes allocator first |
| Composition Over Inheritance | **A+** | Panel wraps renderables, Layout nests arbitrarily |
| Fail Fast with Clear Errors | **A+** | Specific error sets, no `catch unreachable` |
| Performance as Feature | **A** | Comptime tables, segment reuse, lazy rendering |

### Remaining Gaps

1. **Documentation coverage** - Listed at 25%, should be 100% for 1.0
   - No standalone API reference
   - No separate `examples/` directory (all demos in 25K-line main.zig)
   - No FAQ/troubleshooting guide

2. **Syntax highlighting** - Missing tab expansion feature (minor)

3. **Large file sizes** - Some modules could be split:
   - `console.zig` (42K lines)
   - `logging.zig` (45K lines)
   - `main.zig` (25K lines - demo should be examples)

4. **No published benchmarks** - SPEC.md defines performance targets but no measurements

### Verdict

**The vision is achieved.** rich_zig is production-ready for:
- Building CLI tools with rich terminal output
- Demonstrating Zig library design patterns
- Serving as the "first brick" for a Zig application ecosystem

The ~95% feature parity claim is accurate. The codebase is clean, consistent, and follows all stated design principles. What remains is polish (documentation, examples, benchmarks) rather than core functionality.
