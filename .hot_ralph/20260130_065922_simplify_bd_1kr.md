I'll review the recent code changes and use the code-simplifier agent to refine them.The most recent commit is just a beads tracking update. Let me look at the actual code changes for the Markdown Images feature:I see the recent changes were to `syntax.zig`. Let me check for the Markdown Images task specifically - it might be uncommitted or in a different location:Let me check the task file to understand what changes were made for the Markdown Images feature:I see - the task bd-1kr (Markdown Images) found that the feature was already implemented. The task file shows no new code was written since the feature already existed. Let me check the simplify task file to see what was found:The simplify task file is incomplete - it looks like it captured my current session. Let me look at the actual markdown.zig code to do a proper review:The code-simplifier agent found and made an improvement. Let me verify the change and run the tests myself:The tests pass and the change is clean. The simplification removes the unnecessary `tryParseLinkAt` wrapper function by inlining its implementation into `tryParseLink`. Let me commit this:Now let me close the beads issue since the task is complete:Done. Here's the summary:

**Task: Markdown: Images (show alt text)**

The image support was already fully implemented in `src/renderables/markdown.zig`. The code-simplifier agent found one improvement:

**Simplification made** (`src/renderables/markdown.zig`):
- Removed the unnecessary `tryParseLinkAt` wrapper function (-5 lines)
- Inlined its implementation into `tryParseLink`
- `tryParseImage` now calls `tryParseLink` directly

All 637 tests pass. Changes committed.
