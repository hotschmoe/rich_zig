I'll analyze this task to understand what's being asked and assess its feasibility.

The task is to display local variable values in stack traces, which would require parsing DWARF debug information at runtime. Let me explore the current state of the logging module and understand what's involved.Now let me check the SPEC.md to understand the requirements better, and also examine what's already present in the codebase regarding debug info parsing:This is a critical finding. Looking at SPEC.md line 38:

> **Traceback with local variables | Requires debug info parsing** 

This feature is explicitly listed under **"Out of Scope"** in the project specification.

Let me also check what Zig's standard library provides for debug info to understand the technical feasibility:Based on my research, I need to report the outcome of this task clearly.

## Task Assessment: Cannot Implement

**The task "Show local variables in tracebacks" cannot be implemented.** Here's why:

### 1. Explicitly Out of Scope in SPEC.md

The project specification at `/home/hotschmoe/rich_zig/SPEC.md:38` explicitly lists this feature as **Out of Scope**:

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Traceback with local variables | Requires debug info parsing |

### 2. Technical Infeasibility in Zig

Based on my research:

- **Zig issue [#6014](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/6014)**: "Emit DWARF .debug_info for local variables" is still an open issue targeted for Zig 0.14.0. The Zig compiler does not yet emit the necessary DWARF information for local variables.

- **Zig issue [#20258](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/20258)**: As of Zig 0.13.0, debuggers cannot access local variable debug information because it's not being generated.

- **`std.debug` limitations**: While Zig's standard library can parse DWARF for stack traces and line numbers (as seen in the existing `captureCurrentTrace` implementation at `logging.zig:618-657`), it cannot access local variable values because:
  1. The compiler doesn't emit the necessary DWARF DIEs (Debug Information Entries) for local variables
  2. Even if it did, reading runtime variable values would require either debugger-level memory introspection or explicit runtime instrumentation

### 3. What Would Be Required

To implement this feature would require:
1. Waiting for Zig 0.14.0+ which may include local variable debug info
2. Implementing DWARF expression evaluation to decode variable locations (registers, stack offsets, etc.)
3. Reading live memory values from the current stack frame
4. This is effectively implementing a partial debugger - far beyond the scope of a terminal formatting library

### Conclusion

**This task should be marked as "will not implement"** - it's explicitly excluded from the project scope and is technically infeasible with current Zig capabilities. The SPEC.md correctly identifies this as requiring "debug info parsing" that Zig's ecosystem doesn't yet fully support.
