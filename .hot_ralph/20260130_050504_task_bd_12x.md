I'll implement horizontal rule rendering for the Markdown renderer. Let me first understand the existing code structure.Let me read the markdown.zig file in chunks to understand its structure.Let me continue reading to see the inline text rendering and look for where I should add horizontal rule support.Now I understand the structure. I need to:
1. Add horizontal rule styling to `MarkdownTheme`
2. Add a `parseHorizontalRule` function
3. Add the horizontal rule check in the `render` method
4. Reuse `Rule` from rule.zig

Let me also check the tests at the end of the file and look for how imports work.Let me see the rest of the tests and find the end of the file.Let me check the end of the file to see where tests end.Now I have a good understanding of the structure. Let me implement horizontal rules. I'll need to:

1. Add `rule_style` and `rule_char` to `MarkdownTheme`
2. Add a `parseHorizontalRule` function to detect `---`, `***`, or `___` patterns
3. Integrate the check in the `render` method
4. Use the `Rule` renderable from rule.zig

Let me make the changes:Now I need to add the `parseHorizontalRule` function and integrate it into the render method. Let me find the right spot to add the function (near `parseHeader`).Now I need to add the horizontal rule rendering method and integrate it into the render method. Let me first add the `renderHorizontalRule` helper method, then update the render method.Now I need to integrate the horizontal rule check in the render method. It should be checked before the block elements. Let me insert it after the header check.Now let me add the tests for horizontal rule parsing. I'll add them at the end of the file.Now let me run the tests to validate the implementation.Tests pass. Let me also run the tests with a filter to verify only the markdown tests are passing.Let me also verify the build compiles properly.Now let me commit the changes. First, let me check the git status.Task completed successfully.

## Summary

Implemented horizontal rule rendering for the Markdown renderer:

1. **Added imports**: Imported `Rule` from `rule.zig` to reuse existing horizontal rule rendering logic

2. **Extended MarkdownTheme** (`markdown.zig:59-60`):
   - `rule_style`: Style for the rule line (defaults to bright black foreground)
   - `rule_char`: Character used for the rule (defaults to Unicode box-drawing character `\u{2500}`)

3. **Added parseHorizontalRule function** (`markdown.zig:512-530`):
   - Detects CommonMark thematic breaks: `---`, `***`, `___`
   - Supports spaced variants: `- - -`, `* * *`, `_ _ _`
   - Handles leading/trailing whitespace
   - Requires at least 3 rule characters

4. **Integrated in render method** (`markdown.zig:270-276`):
   - Checks for horizontal rules after headers but before blockquotes
   - Uses the `Rule` renderable with theme-configured style and character

5. **Added tests**: 10 new tests covering:
   - Basic dashes, asterisks, and underscores
   - Spaced variants
   - Invalid inputs (too few chars, mixed chars, etc.)
   - Full render integration tests
   - Theme style verification
