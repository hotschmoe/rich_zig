I'll review the recent code changes for the logging integration task and simplify them if needed.The most recent commit added the logging module. Let me read the new logging.zig file to review and simplify it.Now let me run the tests to see if they pass as-is.Tests pass. Now let me analyze the logging.zig code for simplification opportunities. I'll use the code-simplifier agent.The code-simplifier agent made good improvements. Let me verify the changes and run tests one more time.Tests pass. Let me check the current state of the file to confirm the changes.The simplifications look good:
1. **Removed 4 unused imports** - `Text`, `Segment`, `segment`, and `cells` were never used
2. **Consolidated duplicate level string logic** - reused `Level.fromStdLevel(level).toString()` instead of duplicating the switch statement

Now let me commit these changes.Done. The logging module has been simplified:

**Changes made:**
1. Removed 4 unused imports (`Text`, `Segment`, `segment`, `cells`)
2. Consolidated duplicate level-to-string logic in `stdLogFn` by reusing `Level.fromStdLevel(level).toString()` instead of a separate switch statement

All tests pass. The commit is `d7e6796`.
