I'll implement formatted tracebacks for the logging module. Let me start by exploring the current codebase to understand the existing patterns and what's already in place.Let me also read the segment, style, and color modules to understand the patterns better.Now I have a good understanding of the codebase. Let me look at the renderables panel for patterns on how to implement renderables.Now I have a good understanding of the patterns. Let me implement the traceback functionality. The implementation will include:

1. **Traceback** - Data structure to hold parsed stack trace information
2. **StackFrame** - Individual frame with file, line, function name
3. **TracebackTheme** - Styling configuration for traceback rendering
4. **Rendering with syntax highlighting and source context**Now let me update the root.zig to export the new traceback types.Now let's run the tests to validate the implementation.I need to fix the Segment type reference in the function signatures. They need to be using the import at the module level.Now I need to fix the function signatures to use the module-level import and remove the local imports within the functions.I need to remove the local imports since I've added them at the top of the file.Now let me find and fix the renderSourceContext function as well.Now let's run the tests again.All tests pass. Now let's also run with optimizations to make sure everything is robust.Let me also verify the code compiles correctly for the library build.All builds pass. Now let me commit the changes.Successfully implemented formatted tracebacks for the logging module. Here's a summary of what was added:

## Summary

Added comprehensive traceback support to `src/logging.zig` with the following components:

### Data Structures
- **`StackFrame`**: Represents a single frame with file, line, column, function name, and address
- **`Traceback`**: Collection of frames with error message, source caching, and rendering
- **`TracebackTheme`**: Customizable styling for all traceback elements (error, title, file, line numbers, function names, etc.)
- **`TracebackOptions`**: Configuration for rendering (context lines, line numbers, addresses, box decoration)

### Features
- **Stack trace parsing**: Parse Zig stack trace strings into structured frames
- **Runtime capture**: Capture current stack trace via `std.debug`
- **Source context**: Display surrounding source code with the error line highlighted
- **Column indicator**: Show a caret (`^`) pointing to the exact column
- **Box decoration**: Wrap output in a styled Panel with rounded borders
- **Theme presets**: `default` (colorful) and `minimal` (subdued)

### Helper Functions
- `traceHere(allocator)`: Create a traceback from the current call site
- `traceError(allocator, err)`: Create a traceback with an error name

### Tests
Added 11 tests covering:
- StackFrame formatting
- Traceback initialization and configuration
- Zig trace parsing
- Theme configurations
- Rendering output verification
