I'll review the recent code changes for the Markdown Images (alt text) feature and simplify if needed.Let me read the full markdown.zig file to understand the context better and identify simplification opportunities.Now let me run the tests to verify everything is working:Tests pass. Now let me analyze the code changes more carefully for simplification opportunities.Now I can see the full picture. The code changes are well-structured. Let me look for potential simplifications:

1. **`ImageResult` and `LinkResult` are structurally similar** - both have `text`, `url`, and `end_pos`. They could potentially share a common type.

2. **`tryParseImage` and `tryParseLink` share similar structure** - the core parsing logic after initial character detection is nearly identical.

Let me check if consolidation would be beneficial:I see an opportunity to simplify. The `ImageResult` and `LinkResult` types are nearly identical, and `tryParseImage` essentially calls `tryParseLink` with a prefix check. Let me consolidate them:Now update `tryParseLink` to use a helper and fix the call sites:Now I need to update the call site in `parseInlineStyles` to use `.text` instead of `.link_text`:Now I need to update the call site for image as well - it uses `.alt_text`:Now I need to update the test that references `.alt_text`:Now let's run the tests to verify:There are a few more `.link_text` references in tests that need to be updated:All tests pass. Now let me verify the diff shows the simplification:The simplification looks good. The changes:
1. Removed duplicate `ImageResult` struct - now uses `LinkResult` for both
2. Simplified `tryParseImage` to just check for `!` prefix and delegate to link parsing logic
3. Unified the field name from `link_text`/`alt_text` to just `text`

Let me update the version in build.zig.zon for this refactor:Done. I reviewed the markdown image alt text feature and simplified the code:

**Changes made:**
1. **Removed duplicate `ImageResult` struct** - both images and links now use `LinkResult`
2. **Simplified `tryParseImage`** - now just checks for `!` prefix and delegates to link parsing logic (3 lines instead of 15)
3. **Unified field names** - `link_text`/`alt_text` became just `text`

**Result:** Net reduction of 17 lines (-35 added, +18 removed) while preserving all functionality. All tests pass.
