I'll review the recent code changes for the "Syntax: Add background color" task and use the code-simplifier agent to refine them.

Let me first check the recent changes.Now let me run the code-simplifier agent to review and simplify this code.The code-simplifier agent has reviewed and made minor simplifications to the syntax.zig file. The changes were:

1. **Standardized `defaultSegment` vs `styledSegment` usage** - Three locations were changed to use `defaultSegment` for consistency when handling fallback/plain text
2. **Removed a redundant comment** - The comment "Apply background to wrapped segment" was self-explanatory

All tests pass. Let me now check git status to see if there are uncommitted changes from the simplification.Good, there are simplification changes. Let me run the tests one more time to confirm everything passes before committing.Tests pass. Now let me commit these simplifications.Done. The code simplification review is complete.

**Summary of changes:**

1. **Removed redundant comment** - "Apply background to wrapped segment" was self-explanatory from the function name

2. **Standardized `defaultSegment` usage** - Three places were using `styledSegment(..., self.theme.default_style)` when `defaultSegment(...)` was more appropriate:
   - `highlightZig`: Non-builtin `@foo` tokens (line 776)
   - `highlightZig`: Fallback characters (line 818)  
   - `highlightJson`: Fallback characters (line 867)

The distinction is now clear and consistent:
- `styledSegment`: For explicitly styled tokens (keywords, strings, etc.)
- `defaultSegment`: For unstyled/plain text that should use theme defaults

All tests pass and the commit has been made.
