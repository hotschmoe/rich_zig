I'll review the recent code changes and simplify them using the code-simplifier agent.The code-simplifier agent successfully reviewed and simplified the input prompt code. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Simplifications Made to `src/prompt.zig`

**1. Removed 5 unused imports** - Cleaned up imports that weren't actually used in the code.

**2. Replaced `Self` with explicit type names** - Now uses `Prompt`, `IntPrompt`, `FloatPrompt`, `Confirm` consistently with codebase conventions.

**3. Extracted 3 helper functions:**
- `stripCarriageReturn` - Consolidates Windows line-ending handling
- `isAffirmative` - Extracts yes/true/1/y matching
- `isNegative` - Extracts no/false/0/n matching

**4. Simplified nested conditionals** - Combined `if` statements with `and` where appropriate.

**5. Simplified null handling** - Used `orelse` pattern instead of verbose null checks.

**6. Simplified style rendering loop** - Reduced code duplication in `writeStyledPrompt`.

**7. Simplified Confirm default hint** - Consolidated Y/n hint generation into a single expression.

**8. Removed redundant comments** - Comments that stated the obvious were removed.

**Result:** Reduced from 809 to 727 lines (~10% reduction) while preserving all functionality. All tests pass.

Would you like me to commit these simplification changes?
