I'll review the code changes made for the Markdown Strikethrough task and use the code-simplifier agent to refine the code.The code-simplifier agent has completed its work. Let me verify the changes were committed and tests pass.The simplification is complete. Here's a summary:

## Simplification Results

**Commit:** `f6c5c12 refactor: simplify code from strikethrough feature`

**Changes made to `src/renderables/markdown.zig`:**

1. **Removed redundant bounds check** - The `if (content_start >= text.len) return null;` check was unnecessary since `findClosingDelimiter` already handles this edge case

2. **Changed return type to `InlineCodeResult`** - The strikethrough parser now returns `InlineCodeResult` instead of `ParseResult`, matching the pattern used by `tryParseInlineCode`

3. **Updated call site** - Changed from `result.style_type` to `.strikethrough` directly for clarity

**Net result:** -3 lines, improved consistency with existing codebase patterns, tests verified passing.
